## Introduction

Proprioception is the sense of relative body position in space and is necessary for completing complex motor tasks. There are specialized sensors in the muscle that sends information to the brain about muscle length and body position. This information is in the form of action potentials, in which the strength of the stimulus is coded into the frequency of the action potentials that are generated. In our experiments, a specific muscle is isolated and subjected to a series of ramp-and-hold stretches. Through extracellular recording, action potentials of a single neuron are recorded. The raw neural signal is then translated into quantifiable measurement, instantaneous firing frequency, which can be analyzed to compare changes under different conditions. 

The following code allows us to visualize changes in instantaneous firing frequency under different conditions (doses of glutamate and xanthurenic acid). 

## Download packages

```{r packages, warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(readxl)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(car)
```

## Import data

The package 'readxl' was used to read the data from each sheet of my excel workbook. Each sheet contains data for different drugs and drug doses. This package allowed me to get all of the sheet names and put the sheets into a list of data frames, I then separated them into varying data frames named after their respective worksheet name. 

The important variables to note are: dose, position, animal number, and values at time 0 - 59.5 minutes. 

```{r importData}
# Read all sheets and have each worksheet in a list of data frames 
readAllSheets = function(filename) {
    sheets = readxl::excel_sheets(filename)
    x = lapply(sheets, function(X) readxl::read_excel(filename, sheet = X))
    names(x) = sheets
    x
}
mySheets = readAllSheets("../data/MasterGlutamateSpreadsheet.xlsx")

# Create an environment containing all list components 
list2env(mySheets, .GlobalEnv)

# Combine all sheets into one data frame 
df = do.call("rbind", mySheets)
str(df)
```

## Including plots for over time data

In the in vitro muscle-nerve experiments, muscles were stretched for a duration of 4 seconds. Instantaneous frequency of the neural firing were recorded at different time points of that ramp-and-hold stretches. Initial Static Time (IST) is the average instantaneous frequency at 0.4 - 0.6 seconds into the stretch. Final Static Time (FST) is the average instantaneous frequency at 3.25 - 3.75 seconds into the stretch. Dynamic Peak (DP) is the highest instantaneous frequency during the ramp up portion of the ramp-and-hold stretch. Dynamic Index (DI) describes the difference in firing between DP and IST. FST, IST, and DP values are included in the excel workbook.

The graphs below shows the effect of the drug dose in comparison to the control over time.

## Including scatterplots for peak FST and DI 

Glutamate is present in the terminal ends of the sensory neurons that innervate the proprioceptive sensory organ, the muscle spindle. Glutamate is thought to increase the sensitivity and responsiveness, which is why we want to see the peak FST values in each trial. By blocking the packaging of glutamate into synaptic-like vesicles by xanthurenic acid, the glutamate content should be depleted over time, which is why we wanted to see the minimum values per trial upon XA exposure.

The maximum change of glutamate of each trial is plotted in comparison to the control trials. Whereas, the minimum change of xanthurenic acid of each trial is plotted in comparison to the control trials.

Each point represents the maximum/minimum value of a trial.

```{r plotSCFST, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, dpi = 300}
##### Plot maximum FST for glutamate #####

# Create a data frame with only instantaneous frequency as a percentage of baseline

## Statistics 

Maximum changes in FST and compared by condition or responder using a One-Way ANOVA with Tukey HSD. This is used to test the significance between two means. There are more control files that have not been analyzed yet, and therefore not included in this code. Significance may change once all files are included (or exclusion of some current files).    

```{r Stats, results='asis'}
anovaGluFST = aov(max ~ Dose, data = gluPercentBL)
kable(Anova(anovaGluFST, type = 3), digits = 3)

anovaXA = aov(min ~ Dose, data = XAPercentBL)
kable(Anova(anovaXA, type = 3), digits = 3)

anovaGluDI = aov(max ~ Dose, data = gluDIpercentBL)
kable(Anova(anovaGluDI, type = 3), digits = 3)

anovaXADI = aov(min ~ Dose, data = XADIpercentBL)
kable(Anova(anovaXADI, type = 3), digits = 3)
```
