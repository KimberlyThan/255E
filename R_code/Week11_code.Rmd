## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
summary(pressure)
pressure = pressure
```

```{r pressure2, dpi = 300}
plot(pressure, col = 'blue')
```

```{r pressure3, dpi = 300, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 7}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r pressure4, dpi = 300, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, dev = c('png', 'pdf')}
plot(pressure, col = 'red')
```

```{r basicSetup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = 'figs/', cache = TRUE)
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
diamonds = diamonds
```
