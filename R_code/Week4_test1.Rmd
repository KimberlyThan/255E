## R Markdown Example

This is an R Markdown document. In this plain-text section, you can write 
descriptions of what the document contains, what the analysis steps are, where
you obtained the data, etc. 

For this example, we could import the two SVLCallisaurus files, join them, 
and then produce a boxplot showing the snout-vent lengths of males and 
females separately. 


### Setting the working directory
<!-- Here is a markdown-style (html-style) comment -->
I don't bother setting a working directory when using RStudio to 
generate a Word or HTML document from this .Rmd file. The default
behavior of RStudio when you hit the Knit button, is to use the
.Rmd file's directory as the working directory. That means your 
directory paths to things like the data files need to be set 
relative to the storage directory of the .Rmd file. 
```{r workingdir}
# Here is a comment within a R code chunk
# setwd("~/Dropbox/255E_BIOL/Week_4")
```

## Importing data
Next I'll import the two data files. Because the working directory used by RStudio (where this .Rmd file lives) is a sub-directory of my main `255E_BIOL` directory, I need to use the 
`../data/` syntax when trying to get to my `data` folder. 

```{r importData}
svl1 = read.csv("../data/SVLCallisaurus.csv")
svl2 = read.csv("../data/SVLCallisaurus2.csv")
```

## Merging the two data sets
Because the two data sets share the same number of columns with the same 
data types in each, and the same column titles, we can used the `rbind` 
(row bind)
function to merge them.

```{r mergeFiles}
svlAll = rbind(svl1,svl2)
```

## Including Plots
Now we can make a boxplot showing the distributions of snout-vent length
for males and females.

```{r boxplot1, echo = TRUE, fig.cap="Boxplot of salary distributions."}
boxplot(Snout.Vent.Length..mm.~Sex, data = svlAll, xlab = 'Sex',
        ylab = 'Snout Vent Length, mm')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk in the
original .Rmd file to prevent 
printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including R results
We can also have R print out the results of a calculation to the output 
document, similar to how a R function might normally print its results to 
the console.
```{r calculationExample}
# Use aggregate function to calculate mean for each sex separately
mymeans = aggregate(Snout.Vent.Length..mm.~Sex, data = svlAll, 
                    FUN = mean)
mymeans # print output
```

We can also use the `kable` function to make a nicely formatted table out of a 
data frame.

```{r meansTable, results='asis'}
kable(mymeans, caption = 'Mean lengths for each sex.')
```
