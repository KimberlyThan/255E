## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r functionExample1}
myFunction <- function(x){
  print(x)
}
```

The above code creates a new function `myFunction`. It takes a single argument `x`, and when the function executes, it will print out the contents 
of `x` to the console (or output document).

```{r functionExample2}
myFunction(x = 2)

myFunction(x = c(1,2,3,4))
```

This basic function is fairly useless, since it recreates the existing `print()` function. Normally you would insert more code in the curly braces
to do so.

```{r functionExample3}
myFunction2 <- function(x,y){
  z = x + y
  z
}

results = myFunction(2,4)
print(results)
```
Note that in the code above, we run the function and assign the results to a new variable called `results`. To actually show what was 
calculated, we have to print out `result`. If we ran teh function without assigning its reuslts to a variable, it woud just print out the 
contents of `z` to the console. 

```{r seFunction}
mySE <- function(x){
  # Assume the input x is a vector of numbers
  # First caculate the variance
  myvar = var(x)
  # The calculate the number of values in the sample 
  myn = length(x)
  # Next calcuate the square root of the variance divide by sample size
  mySE = sqrt( myvar / myn )
  # The value returned will be the last object created in the fucntion, in this case mySE
  mySE # repeating just the last variable here will cause the result to print out when run
}

# source("../R_code/Week6_functions.R")
# can use the above if you did not want to include this code 
```

Now we can test the function:
```{r testSE}
x = c(1,1,3,3,6,6)
mySE(x) # Result shudl be 0.9189366
```

```{r aggregateCustomFunction}
# Make a practice data frame
mydf = data.frame(Group = c(rep('A',6), rep('B',6)),
                            Values = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,11,22,33,44,55,66))
mydf # Print it out
# Calculate the SE of Group A (rows 1-6)
mySE(mydf$Values[1:6])
# Calculate the SE of Group B (rows 7-12)
mySE(mydf$Values[7:12])

# Now use our custom mySE function insdie aggregate() to accomplish the same thing 
aggregate(Values~Group, data = mydf, FUN = mySE)

```
